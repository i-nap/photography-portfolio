            Hi, I'm Aditi Shrestha, a Media student at Kathmandu University, KUSOA, driven by a passion for creativity âœ¨ and storytelling. Photography ðŸ“¸ is more than just a hobby for meâ€”it's a way to capture emotions, preserve memories, and express my unique perspective of the world. Inspired by the beauty in everyday moments, I enjoy experimenting with light, composition, and angles to bring my visions to life.  </span>
